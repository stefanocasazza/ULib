This directory will include demo programs that were used for testing out the ULib library.
These demos are not necessarly meant to serve any purpose other than educational.
They are not normally "built" unless you enter this directory, and they are not meant to be "installed" for general use.
They are here both to educate how ULib works and for internal testing.
